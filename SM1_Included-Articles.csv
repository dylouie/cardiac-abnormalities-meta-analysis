Methods: We included 244 COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to Renmin  Hospital of Wuhan University with no preexisting cardiovascular disease or renal  dysfunction. We analyzed the data including patients' clinical characteristics,  cardiac biomarkers, severity of medical conditions, and 30-day in-hospital fatality.  We performed multivariable Cox regressions and the receiver operating characteristic  analysis to assess the association of cardiac biomarkers on admission with disease  severity and prognosis. Results: In this retrospective observational study, 11% of  COVID-19 patients had increased hs-cTnI levels (>40 ng/L) on admission. Of note,  serum hs-cTnI levels were positively associated with the severity of medical  conditions (median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 6.00 [6.00-6.00] ng/L in 91 patients  with moderate conditions, 6.00 [6.00-18.00] ng/L in 107 patients with severe  conditions, and 11.00 [6.00-56.75] ng/L in 46 patients with critical conditions, P  for trend=0.001). Moreover, compared with those with normal cTnI levels, patients  with increased hs-cTnI levels had higher in-hospital fatality (adjusted hazard ratio  [95% CI]: 4.79 [1.46-15.69]). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis  suggested that the inclusion of hs-cTnI levels into a panel of empirical prognostic  factors substantially improved the prediction performance for severe or critical  conditions (area under the curve (AUC): 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78) vs. 0.65  (0.58-0.72), P=0.01), as well as for 30-day fatality (AUC: 0.91 (0.85-0.96) vs. 0.77  (0.62-0.91), P=0.04). A cutoff value of 20 ng/L of hs-cTnI level led to the best  prediction to 30-day fatality. Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients with no preexisting  cardiovascular disease, 11% had increased hs-cTnI levels. Besides empirical  prognostic factors, serum hs-cTnI levels upon admission provided independent  prediction to both the severity of the medical condition and 30-day in-hospital  fatality. These findings may shed important light on the clinical management of  COVID-19.","2020","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","","9663-9673","","21","10","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","PMID: 32863952  PMCID: PMC7449913","","C:\Users\Louie Florendo Dy\Zotero\storage\WPI49GL8\Cao et al. - 2020 - Myocardial injury and COVID-19 Serum hs-cTnI leve.pdf","","Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; Prognosis; China; Cohort Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; *COVID-19; Hospitalization; Troponin I/*blood; *in-hospital fatality; *myocardial injury; *Troponin I; Cardiomyopathies/blood/*etiology; Coronavirus Infections/blood/*complications/mortality; Pneumonia, Viral/blood/*complications/mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A cross-sectional study was designed on 150 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the fever clinic of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January to February in 2020, including 126 mild cases and 24 cases in critical care. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of past medical history including hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) , as well as the levels of serum NT-proBNP and cTnI to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Results Age, hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP) and serum creatinine levels of the patients were higher in critical care cases than in mild cases(all P <0.05). Prevalence of male, elevated NT-proBNP and cTnI, hypertension and coronary heart disease were significantly higher in critical cases care patients than in the mild cases(all P <0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, male, elevated NT-proBNP, elevated cTnI, elevated hs-CRP, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and CHD were significantly correlated with critical disease status(all P <0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated cTnI( OR =26.909, 95% CI 4.086-177.226, P =0.001) and CHD ( OR =16.609, 95% CI 2.288-120.577, P =0.005) were the independent risk factors of critical disease status. Conclusions COVID-19 can significantly affect the heart function and lead to myocardial injury. The past medical history of CHD and increased level of cTnI are two independent determinants of clinical disease status in patients with COVID-19.","2020-03-06","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-09-27 09:29:12","E008-E008","","00","48","","","","","","","","","","ch","info: Chinese Medical Association and Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co., Ltd.","","","","rs.yiigle.com","","Number: 00 Publisher: Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co., Ltd.","","C:\Users\Louie Florendo Dy\Zotero\storage\VS467UVL\Chen et al. - 2020 - Analysis of myocardial injury in patients with COV.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and  outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.  METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study took place at two  NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical  Center in northern Manhattan. We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ≥18  years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed  with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic  respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data. The  primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included  frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor  use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration  following admission. The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and  in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at  least 28 days of observation. FINDINGS: Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150  adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which  257 (22%) were critically ill. The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51-72),  171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most  common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%)  patients had obesity. As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%)  remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation  for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors  and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy. The median time to in-hospital  deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6). In the multivariable Cox model, older age  (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac  disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]),  higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile  increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile  increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. INTERPRETATION:  Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is  common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation,  extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.

Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be  considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore,  we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence  for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. METHODS: We  enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected  heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory  results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the  analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. RESULTS: 112 COVID-19 patients  were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19  patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis.  Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%)  patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin  levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%)  patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of  myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. CONCLUSIONS: The  clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely  related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel  coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and  systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse  clinical outcomes of the patients.","2020-07-15","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","","116-121","","","311","","Int J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The cardiac injury is a common  condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N terminal  pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19  patients was unknown. METHODS: The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe  COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54  patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death  defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were  obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP  for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and  the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (> 88.64 pg/mL) had  a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared  with those with low values (≤88.64 pg/mL). After adjustment for potential risk  factors, NT-proBNP was independently correlated with in-hospital death.

Yet, scarce information is available regarding the morphological and functional features of cardiac impairments in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective and serial echocardiographic study to investigate the structural and functional cardiac changes among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). From January 21 to April 8, 2020, a total of 51 ICU patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were monitored by serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations. Outcomes were followed up until April 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of 51 ICU patients, 33 (64.7%) had cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevations of levels of cardiac biomarkers including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide were observed in 62.7% and 86.3% of patients, respectively. Forty-two (82.3%) had at least one left-heart and/or right-heart echocardiographic abnormality. The overall median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65.0% (IQR 58.0-69.0%), with most (44,86.3%) having preserved LVEF. Sixteen patients (31.4%) had increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and 14 (27.5%) had right-ventricle (RV) enlargement. During the study period, 12 (23.5%) patients died. LVEF was comparable between survivors and non-survivors, while non-survivors had more often pulmonary hypertension (58.3% vs. 23.1%; P=0.028) and RV enlargement (58.3% vs. 17.9%, P=0.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated similar survival curves between patients with vs. without echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities (P=0.450 by log-rank test), while right-heart abnormalities had adverse impact on mortality (P=0.012 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Typical cardiac abnormality in ICU patients with COVID-19 was right-heart dysfunction with preserved LVEF. Echocardiographic right-heart dysfunction was associated with disease severity and increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Trial NCT04352842Funding StatementThis work is supported by National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [81625002], National Natural Science Foundation of China (81930007, 81770238), Shanghai Outstanding Academic Leaders Program (18XD1402400), Shanghai Shen Kang Hospital Development Center (16CR3034A), and Shanghai Health and Family Planning commission (20184Y0022).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, nested-cohort study. Sixty-one EDs included a  random sample of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30,  2020. Demographic and baseline health information, including concomitant conditions;  clinical characteristics related to the ED visit and complementary test results; and  treatments were recorded throughout the episode in the ED. We calculated crude and  adjusted odds ratios for risk of in-hospital death and a composite outcome  consisting of the following events: intensive care unit admission, orotracheal  intubation or mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. The logistic regression  models were constructed with 3 groups of independent variables: the demographic and  baseline health characteristics, clinical characteristics and complementary test  results related to the ED episode, and treatments. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of  patients was 62 (18) years. Most had high- or low-grade fever, dry cough, dyspnea,  and diarrhea. The most common concomitant conditions were cardiovascular diseases,  followed by respiratory diseases and cancer. Baseline patient characteristics that  showed a direct and independent association with worse outcome (death and the  composite outcome) were age and obesity. Clinical variables directly associated with  worse outcomes were impaired consciousness and pulmonary crackles; headache was  inversely associated with worse outcomes. Complementary test findings that were  directly associated with outcomes were bilateral lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, a  high platelet count, a D-dimer concentration over 500 mg/dL, and a  lactate-dehydrogenase concentration over 250 IU/L in blood. CONCLUSION: This profile  of the clinical characteristics and comorbidity of patients with COVID-19 treated in  EDs helps us predict outcomes and identify cases at risk of exacerbation. The  information can facilitate preventive measures and improve outcomes.","2020","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","","233-241","","4","32","","Emergencias","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 32692000","","C:\Users\Louie Florendo Dy\Zotero\storage\7X57EMT6\Gil-Rodrigo et al. - 2020 - Analysis of clinical characteristics and outcomes .pdf","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Respiration, Artificial/statistics & numerical data; Comorbidity; Prognosis; Young Adult; Adolescent; Age Factors; *Betacoronavirus; Age Distribution; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology; Prospective Studies; *SARS-CoV-2; *COVID-19; Hospital Mortality; Sex Distribution; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; *Comorbidity; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Spain/epidemiology; Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data; *Características clínicas; *Clinical characteristics; *Comorbilidades; *Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); *Emergency health services; *Servicios de urgencias; *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); *Symptom Assessment; Coronavirus Infections/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy; Intubation, Intratracheal/statistics & numerical data; Neoplasms/epidemiology; Obesity/complications; Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy; Respiration Disorders/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the  clinical characteristics and therapies of severe cases in Jiangsu Province. METHODS:  A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze clinical,  laboratory data and treatment of 60 severe cases with COVID-19 infection in Jiangsu  Province between January 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The improvement and  deterioration subgroups were compared to identify predictors of disease progression.  RESULTS: A total of 653 infected cases with COVID-19 were reported in Jiangsu  Province, of which 60 severe cases were included in this study. Up until April 20,  2020, the mortality of severe patients was 0%. The median age was 57 years. The  average body mass index of these patients was 25 kg/m². White blood cell counts  decreased in 45.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 63.3%, thrombocytopenia in 13.3% and  procalcitonin levels in 88.3% of the patients were less than 0.5 ng/mL. There were  no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and GCs therapy  between the improvement and deterioration subgroups. Logistic regression analysis  identified higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence  interval [CI]: 1.00-1.08; P = 0.04), antiviral therapy with aerosol inhalation of  interferon (OR: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.18-33.98; P = 0.03), and the application of  non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.17-3.41; P = 0.01) as  predictors of disease progression, whereas higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0.11; 95%  CI: 0.02-0.57; P = 0.01) and early prone ventilation were associated with  improvement (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.98; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection  had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. The higher levels of troponin T  and lower lymphocyte count were predictors of disease progression. Early prone  ventilation may be an effective treatment for severe cases.","2020-08","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","","120-128","","2","360","","Am J Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

We sought to determine whether the electrocardiogram (ECG)  on hospital presentation provides prognostic information, specifically related to  death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients  with COVID-19 who had an ECG at or near hospital admission. Clinical characteristics  and ECG variables were manually abstracted from the electronic health record and  first ECG. Our primary outcome was death. THERE WERE: 756 patients who presented to  a large New York City teaching hospital with COVID-19 who underwent an ECG. The mean  age was 63.3 ± 16 years, 37% were women, 61% of patients were nonwhite, and 57% had  hypertension; 90 (11.9%) died. In a multivariable logistic regression that included  age, ECG, and clinical characteristics, the presence of one or more atrial premature  contractions (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.36,  P = .01), a right bundle branch block or intraventricular block (OR 2.61, 95% CI  1.32-5.18, P = .002), ischemic T-wave inversion (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.56-7.80,  P = .002), and nonspecific repolarization (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27-4.21, P = .006)  increased the odds of death. ST elevation was rare (n = 5 [0.7%]). CONCLUSIONS: We  found that patients with ECG findings of both left-sided heart disease (atrial  premature contractions, intraventricular block, repolarization abnormalities) and  right-sided disease (right bundle branch block) have higher odds of death. ST  elevation at presentation was rare.","2020-07","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","","626-632","","7","26","","J Card Fail","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: This single-centre, observational, cross-sectional study included 211  patients with COVID-19 admitted to non-ICU departments who underwent a single  transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients with poor acoustic window (n=11) were  excluded. Clinical, imaging, laboratory and TTE findings were compared in patients  with versus without PH (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure >35 mm Hg) and  with versus without RVD (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <17 mm or S wave  <9.5 cm/s). The primary endpoint was in-hospital death or ICU admission. RESULTS: A  total of 200 patients were included in the final analysis (median age 62 (IQR 52-74)  years, 65.5% men). The prevalence of PH and RVD was 12.0% (24/200) and 14.5%  (29/200), respectively. Patients with PH were older and had a higher burden of  pre-existing cardiac comorbidities and signs of more severe severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (radiological lung involvement,  laboratory findings and oxygenation status) compared with those without PH.  Conversely, patients with RVD had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac  comorbidities but no evidence of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with  those without RVD. The presence of PH was associated with a higher rate of  in-hospital death or ICU admission (41.7 vs 8.5%, p<0.001), while the presence of  RVD was not (17.2 vs 11.7%, p=0.404). CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised non-ICU  patients with COVID-19, PH (and not RVD) was associated with signs of more severe  COVID-19 and with worse in-hospital clinical outcome.

We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.Methods:One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared with reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second examination was performed in case of clinical deterioration.Results:Thirty-two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared with patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but they had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure.Conclusions:In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic function and RV function are impaired. Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function. In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without deep vein thrombosis, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in ≈20%.","2020-07-28","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-09-27 09:19:40","342-353","","4","142","","Circulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ahajournals.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Heart Association","","C:\Users\Louie Florendo Dy\Zotero\storage\SPLXV6JA\Szekely Yishay et al. - 2020 - Spectrum of Cardiac Manifestations in COVID-19.pdf; C:\Users\Louie Florendo Dy\Zotero\storage\5LL5QI2K\CIRCULATIONAHA.120.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID‐19 and further determined the risk factors for cardiac involvement in them.Methods and ResultsWe analyzed data from 102 consecutive laboratory‐confirmed and hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 (52 women aged 19–87 years). Epidemiologic and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, chest imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into acute cardiac injury, with and without cardiac marker abnormities groups according to different level of cardiac markers. In this research, cardiac involvement was found in 72 of the 102 (70.6%) patients: tachycardia (n=20), electrocardiography abnormalities (n=23), echocardiography abnormalities (n=59), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=55), and acute cardiac injury (n=9). Eight patients with acute cardiac injury were aged >60 years; seven of them had ≥2 underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia was much more severe in the patients with acute cardiac injury than in patients with nondefinite acute cardiac injury (P<0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that CRP (C‐reactive protein) levels, old age, novel coronavirus pneumonia severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in patients with COVID‐19.ConclusionsCardiac involvements are common in patients with COVID‐19. Elevated CRP levels, old age, underlying comorbidities, and novel coronavirus pneumonia severity are the main risk factors for cardiac involvement in patients with COVID‐19.

Methods We reported 135 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in The First People9s Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China. Demographic data, medical history, and laboratory parameters were taken from inpatient records and compared between patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU isolation wards for prognosis on disease severity. In particular, survivors and non-survivors upon ICU admission were compared for prognosis on disease mortality. Results For COVID-19 patients, blood test results showed more significantly deranged values in the ICU group than those in non-ICU. Among those parameters for ICU patients, myocardial variables including troponin T, creatine kinase isoenzymes, myoglobin, were found significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. Conclusions Upon hospitalization abnormal myocardial metabolism in COVID-19 patients could be prognostic indicators of a worsened outcome for disease severity and mortality.</p>","2020-05-09","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-09-26 10:56:04","2020.05.06.20068882","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

We aimed to assess the association between  Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in  patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of  Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ  Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age  65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji  Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019  hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10,  2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially  eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%)  were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac  arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the  analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health  Evaluation II score (23.23 ± 6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean  Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87 ± 4.40 in survivors  (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was  independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95%  CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic  Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under  the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment  score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area  under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17,  Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of  patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a  specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of  patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health  Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute  Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p <  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an  effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus  disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65  score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal  to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make  further clinical decisions.","2020-08","2020-11-04 09:50:13","2020-11-04 09:50:13","","e657-e665","","8","48","","Crit Care Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32697506  PMCID: PMC7217128","","C:\Users\Louie Florendo Dy\Zotero\storage\AH99JDHT\Zou et al. - 2020 - Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II .pdf","","Adult; Aged; China/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Retrospective Studies; *Hospital Mortality; Predictive Value of Tests; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Logistic Models; Proportional Hazards Models; *Cause of Death; ROC Curve; Causality; Coronavirus Infections/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy; Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Hospitals, Urban; APACHE; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy; Survivors/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
